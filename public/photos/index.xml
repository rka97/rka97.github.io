      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hel_Peninsula&amp;amp;oldid=939640541&#34;&gt;Hel Peninsula&lt;/a&gt; (Polish: Mierzeja Helska) is a 35-km-long sand bar peninsula in northern Poland separating the Bay of Puck from the open Baltic Sea.&#xA;The width of the peninsula varies from approximately 300 m near Jurata, through 100 m in the most narrow part to over 3 km at the tip. Since the peninsula was formed entirely of sand, it is frequently turned into an island by winter storms. Until the 17th century the peninsula was a chain of islands that formed a strip of land only during the summer.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
