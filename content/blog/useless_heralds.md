We are at an exciting point in time-- we might be observing, potentially, the emergence of a so-called AGI, an Artificial General Intelligene. If you believe benchmarks like SWE-Bench for software engineering, GPQA for Ph.D.-level science questions, or EpochAI Frontier Math (for math, duh), then there are now models (like OpenAI's o3) which are quickly approaching human performance. We have no reason to believe this trajectory will not continue. On the contrary, it is *accelerating.* My personal opinion is that artificial intelligence is quite weird and alien, that it will soon (<3 years) overtake the best humans on many tasks (including math) but will still fail in ways that, to us, will be quite perplexing. If this trajectory does not continue, and for some reason human-level performance in reasoning-based tasks remains outside the ability of machine learning models, then this post will be irrelevant.

The purpose of this post is to push back against the sort-of arrogance that some have, about the impact of automation on knowledge work. The many cries about how software engineers (or knowledge workers in general) are "in denial" about being replaced. Well, *it doesn't matter.* You don't need to convince anybody that they're going to be replaced, or that their job is in jeopardy due to AI. Your warnings mean nothing, and there is nothing any individual human being can do. A software engineer who has been "warned" and who sees the writing on the wall can do what? Quit their job and become a salesman? Salesmen will be replaced too. Artificial agents are more persusasive than human beings, they have infinite patience and can do pretend-empathy better than any human can (a machine smarter than Terrence Tao can certainly replace _any_ car salesman). Open up a bakery? I have been asking various language models lately for baking recipes, and in my experience, they give recipes that work as well as most cookbooks. Their output is consistent, testable, and adaptable to any dietary restriction or preference. I have no doubt that with a little more intelligence, and a little more training, and some agentic workflow, an AI-operated bakery can outperform any human bakery.

The heart of the matter is: your "warnings" mean NOTHING. There is no world in which the average knowledge worker is completely displaced and the rest of the world hums along as normal, an economic revolution of this magnitude will shred through every sector, every industry, every economic relationship we've built. The world's economy is too interconnected, too dependent on knowledge workers' economic participation for their displacement to be isolated. When a quarter of the workforce in developed nations suddenly loses their primary source of income, the effects ripple outward with crushing inevitability. The restaurants they frequent close. The services they use shut down. Their children's private schools empty. Their mortgage payments stop. Their investments get liquidated. Their discretionary spending evaporates.

And those are just the obvious, immediate effects. The people who provided those services and depended on that spending then face their own economic crisis. The cascade continues, each wave of displacement feeding into the next. There's no equilibrium where AI displaces knowledge workers but leaves the rest of the economy intact. Buying a farm won't save you, buying land won't save you, stashing some money somewhere won't save you. It is so.. arrogant, insulting even, to suppose that there's anything any of us can do against this onslaught. It reminds me of this quote from Disco Elysium
> “Yes! Abject failure. Total, irreversible defeat on all fronts! Absolutely vanquished, beaten, curb-stomped and pissed on — until *you* came along! *You* will reverse the fortune of the workers of the world. You alone, against every living thing, against every human alive: eight hundred trillion reál in the hands of an *impossibly* well organized ruling class; towering city blocks of bank-men who have the ears of prime ministers; million-headed armies of nations and the love of your own mother! You — against the atom, the charm and the spin. Where the whole world failed — matter failed to bend to human will; human will failed to get out of bed and tie its laces — you alone, single-handedly, will rebuild the dreams of the working class. You are The Last Communist. Now get to work, comrade!”


I had Claude modify this to be about labor displacement from artificial intelligence:

> "Yes! Abject failure. Total, irreversible displacement on all fronts! Absolutely automated, optimized, streamlined and made efficient - until you came along! You will reverse the fortune of the displaced workers of the world. You alone, against every artificial system, against every learning model alive: eight hundred trillion parameters in the hands of an impossibly well-organized tech oligarchy; towering server farms of AI models who have the ears of prime ministers; million-core compute clusters of corporations and the love of your own smartphone! You - against the transformer, the attention and the gradient. Where the whole world failed - human cognition failed to keep up with silicon; human wit failed to outpace the training curve - you alone, single-handedly, will rebuild the relevance of human labor. You are The Last Worker. Now get to work, human."


What good is it to be a herald of the doomsday, when you can offer no salvation?
